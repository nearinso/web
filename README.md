I created a website in html and css, but there are a few problems:
-squares are not responsive
-method with two blocks - one upon the other isn't probably good  but i don't know how to get this effect with other metod.
-the code quality isn't probably that good, so I need tips what to change to be better.
-do I need add new tag's like <header><article> in graphic.html?
-can I use this graphic.html page? or should I do it another way?
